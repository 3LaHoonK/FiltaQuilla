<b>Version 3.3.1</b>

FiltaQuilla is now compatible with Thunderbird 91. FiltaQuilla had to have some necessary changes for Thunderbird 91, for instance the filteraction "match" function has been replace with "matchAction" and changed parameters.

I will try to keep the latest version on ATN compatible with both Thunderbird 78 and ESR 91 as long as possible.

<strong>Support My Work</strong>

As I am often asked about added features for filter conditions and actions for my Add-on <a href="https://addons.thunderbird.net/addon/quickfilters/">quickFilters</a> - FiltaQuilla is a better location for extending Filter behavior - specifically adding new types of Actions and Conditions.
