<b>Version 2.1</b>

Going forward most bugfixes / new features will be exclusively available for Thunderbird 68. The reason for this is that through architectural changes on the Mozilla code platform the code for Thunderbird 60 and earlier is substantially different.

<ul>
<li> Currently working on a version for Thunderbird 78  - you can already <a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/FiltaQuilla/releases/">get prereleases on my github</a>. Complete conversion is discussed at <a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/FiltaQuilla/issues/64">[issue 64]</a></li>
<li> Added Icons and fixed look on Address book picker in Filter Editor</li>
<li> Corrected a string in german lkocale from "Nicht Ã¤ndern" to "Nicht benachrichtigen"</li>
</ul>

As I am often asked about added features for filter conditions and actions for my Add-on <a href="https://addons.thunderbird.net/addon/quickfilters/">quickFilters</a> this is a good location for extending Filter behavior.
