<b>Version 2.1.2</b>

Going forward most bugfixes / new features will be exclusively available for Thunderbird 78 - some changes may be backported to Thunderbird 68. The reason for this is that through architectural changes on the Mozilla code platform the code for Thunderbird 60 and earlier is substantially different.

<ul>
<li> Currently working on a version for Thunderbird 78  - you can already <a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/FiltaQuilla/releases/">get prereleases on my github</a>. Complete conversion is discussed at <a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/FiltaQuilla/issues/64">[issue 64]</a></li>
<li> 2.1.2 fixed a problem in manifest file (stric_max_verseion) that wouldn't allow it to update existing versions.</li>
<li> 2.1.1 added strict_max_version to avoid this Add-on being installed in Tb78 - where it would be incompatible</li>
<li> Added Icons and fixed look on Address book picker in Filter Editor</li>
<li> Corrected a string in german locale from "Nicht Ã¤ndern" to "Nicht benachrichtigen"</li>
<li> <a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/FiltaQuilla/issues/67">[issue 67]</a> Help links in options dialog were misdirected to the wrong page</li>
</ul>
